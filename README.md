Project: Code downloads data from the website of the Central Bank of Guatemala (Banco de Guatemala-BANGUAT). detailing the monthly variations in the CPI index (i.e the evolution of the inflation rate in the country)

The code is shown in a separate script. But it is the source of the PowerBi file, so you can connect the Python.exe in your system to effectively run the file.
